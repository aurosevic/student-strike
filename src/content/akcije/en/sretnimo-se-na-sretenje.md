The choice of february the 15th this year symbolic. The date represented not only the holiday of Sretenje, when the first constitution was adopted, but also the day when students from Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš and other cities gathered in Kragujevac. The support of citizens was not lacking this time either. Everyone gathered in Kragujevac to support the third large and long-planned protest "Let's meet on Sretenje".

What was most striking and different from large protests in other cities was that campfires were burning in the protest zone, creating the impression of a mass camping.

The protest at one point became so massive that the riot police, of whom there were many, could barely maintain order. The streets were overflowing with people, and in some places spontaniously started dacing kolo with great enthusiasm. Inscription "Pump!" dominated on many banners, and was often chanted. The atmosphere reached its peak when, after the end of the protest silence at midnight, someone from the crowd shouted "Pump!", which started a wave.

The cold did not stop people from staying on the streets, but many went into nearby cafes, schools and homes to warm up. The organization was at a high level.

The protest was also attended by people from abroad – a married couple from Greece arrived with their country’s flag, while a man from Canada, born in Kragujevac, came with his family just to participate in the event. Tractors marked the boundaries of the gathering, and from whichever direction the protest was approached, someone offered food, which further strengthened the sense of community.

Kragujevac was nearly unwalkable; several streets were blocked, not just one protest zone. Citizens also came to Kragujevac via side roads, trying to get to the protest.

Various banners alluded to the Sretenj Constitution. Actors and other public figures joined the protest, further drawing public attention to this event.

Šumadija welcomed everyone with warmth and hospitality, a friendly atmosphere and a sense of solidarity. When the protest was over, cleaning the streets went smoothly, as those gathered had already taken care not to leave any trash behind.

This protest in Kragujevac left a strong impression not only because of its massive size, but also because of the unique atmosphere that combined the spirit of struggle, unity and historical symbolism. The gathering of people from different cities and even from abroad showed how universal and significant the values ​​for which they protested are. Spontaneity, energy and solidarity made this event remembered as one of the key moments in the history of student and civic gatherings. Regardless of the further course of the protest, one thing is certain – the spirit that was ignited at Sretenje will continue to burn
