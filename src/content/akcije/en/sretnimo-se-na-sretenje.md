The choice of February 15th this year was symbolic. The date represented not only the holiday of Sretenje (Candlemas), when the first constitution was adopted, but also the day when students from Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš and other cities gathered in Kragujevac. Citizen support was not lacking this time either. Everyone gathered in Kragujevac to support the third large and long-planned protest "Let's meet on Sretenje".

What was most striking and different from large protests in other cities was that campfires were burning in the protest zone, creating the impression of a mass camping, similar to a rafting expedition.

At one point, the protest became so massive that the student monitors, of whom there were many, could barely maintain order. The streets were overflowing with people, and they spontaneously started dancing the kolo folk dance at certain places, with great enthusiasm. The word Pumpaj (“Pump it”) dominated numerous protest signs, and chanting of this word could often be heard. The atmosphere reached its peak when, after the end of the protest silence at midnight, someone from the crowd shouted "Pumpaj!”, which started a wave of further shouts.

The cold did not stop people from staying on the streets, but many went into nearby cafes, schools and homes to warm up. The organization was at a high level.

People from abroad also attended the protest – a married couple from Greece arrived with their country’s flag, while a man from Canada, born in Kragujevac, came with his family just to participate in the event. Tractors marked the boundaries of the gathering, and from whichever direction one approached the protest, someone offered food, which further strengthened the sense of community.

Kragujevac was nearly impossible to walk through; several streets were blocked, not just one protest zone. Citizens also came to Kragujevac via side roads, trying to get to the protest.

The diverse protest signs alluded to the Sretenje Constitution. Actors and other public figures joined the protest, drawing even more public attention to this event.

Šumadija welcomed everyone with warmth and hospitality, a friendly atmosphere and a sense of solidarity. When the protest was over, cleaning the streets went smoothly, as those gathered had already taken care not to leave any rubbish behind.

This protest in Kragujevac left a strong impression not only because of its massive size, but also because of the unique atmosphere that combined the spirit of struggle, unity and historical symbolism. The gathering of people from different cities, and even from abroad, showed how universal and significant the values for which they protested are. Spontaneity, energy and solidarity made this event be remembered as one of the key moments in the history of student and civic gatherings. Regardless of the further course of protests, one thing is certain – the spirit that was ignited at Sretenje will continue to burn.
