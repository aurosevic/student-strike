The wave of one-day civil disobedience was accompanied by students, high school students, university professors, educators, employers, certain trade unions and a large number of citizens. The day was marked by suspension of work and spending reductions, and it began with a gathering in front of the General Staff of the Serbian Armed Forces and the municipality of New Belgrade on the initiative of high school students. A peaceful protest walk in New Belgrade was marred by an incident in which a student of the Faculty of Agriculture was injured. In response to the violence, the students organized a spontaneous protest at Autokomanda, from where people headed to the Supreme Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office, and then to the Radio Television of Serbia, demanding justice and accountability of the institutions.
