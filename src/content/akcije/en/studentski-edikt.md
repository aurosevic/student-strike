At the invitation of the students of the University of Niš, students and citizens from different cities and regions of Serbia gathered in Niš on March 1 for a protest called the "Student Edict". The first of March represents 4 months since the terrible tragedy that befell Novi Sad and Serbia when the canopy collapsed on November 1, 2024, killing 15 people.

The protest lasted a symbolic 18 hours — according to the area code for Niš. Two main squares, Kralj Milan Square and Kralj Aleksandar Ujedinitelj Square, were blocked. Due to the large number of people, there were people both inside the Niš fortress and on the quay. The hospitality and kindness of the Niš citizens was at the highest possible level — some form of service could be found at every corner of the protest.

The protest began with the gathering of students and citizens at four different points in the city, after which rivers of people gathered at Kralj Milan Square to pay their respects to the victims of the falling canopy. Then we had the opportunity to watch the play "Constitution", hear the band, the children's choir, as well as the choir of Students in Blockade, after which the students read their edict.

At 11:52 p.m., paying respect to the victims due to the fall of the canopy was held again. At the end, students and citizens cleaned up Niš and thus the parade around Niš was over.
