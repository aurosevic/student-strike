At the initiative of students from the University of Arts, the Mostar interchange was blockaded, being one of the key traffic areas in Belgrade. Right before the blockade of the Mostar interchange, students gathered in front of the Higher Court in Belgrade (the “Palace of Justice”) while the hearing of the attackers on students of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts was in session.
