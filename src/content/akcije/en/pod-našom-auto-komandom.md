Students in blockades from Belgrade thoroughly planned the first all-day action for January 27th 2025 – a 24-hour blockade of the Autokomanda Interchange.

The day began with students gathering in front of their faculties. Rows of students from different directions flowed towards Autokomanda. It was unusually sunny for January and such a morning indicated a beautiful and warm day. The windows of the buildings, the doors of the local businesses and the bus stops were full of people greeting the students. High school students, along with their teachers, also joined the large number of students.

The blockade was established at 10 am. In those moments, the monitors had the biggest task. They ran carrying concrete blocks, various barricades, watching out for other students. Students of the Faculty of Agriculture came along the highway together with farmers who came with their tractors. Brave tractor drivers traveled from their places the day before to act as barricades for the students. Soon the sound of engines could be heard. Bikers also joined the blockades and were on the front lines. Military veterans soon joined the students.

The most emotional moment of the day followed, at 11.52. Fifteen minutes of silence was held, as is the case every day. The memory of the people who tragically lost their lives in Novi Sad became the bond of all students in the blockade and citizens. Togetherness and empathy gave strength and faith that no one will suffer again due to negligence, ignorance and corruption.

The date of the action was not chosen by chance – January 27th, which is Saint Sava day or School Slava, is also celebrated. Some faculties and religious students prepared slavski kolač (Serbian ritual bread), broke it together and thus marked this day.

In addition to the already mentioned monitors, the students of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine had a great task and an important role in organizing the action. Their building served as a place for the monitors to rest and receive donations brought by citizens throughout the day. The students of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering also took over most of the tasks and provided food for all participants of the blockade. Professional chefs also helped them in this endeavor.

The day passed, and in the evening, Autokomanda became too small for all the people who wanted to join the protest. The Blockade Choir was responsible for the program, and they prepared an appropriate program.

As the night fell, the citizens dispersed, and the students remained on the street. Volleyball and the occasional guitar sound kept them awake. Before dawn, the cleaning began. The garbage truck was parked a bit further away, so the scene of carrying the garbage remained particularly impressive. Maybe there is some symbolism in that too.

After 24 hours, the Autokomanda was passable again. Traffic returned to its normal rhythm, and students returned to their faculties. This action encouraged the students and showed them that they are ready for great endeavors, as long as they stick together.
