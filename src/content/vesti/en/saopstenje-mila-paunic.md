The decision of Dr Mila Paunić to resign from her position at the Institute for Students’ Health due to it preventing employees from expressing support to students is not only an act of personal courage, but also a clear indicator of serious societal issues. The gesture of solidarity and moral integrity simultaneously shines a light on the atmosphere of pressure and fear where even support to students is characterised as an act deserving of sanction.

Such a thing is not only unacceptable, but is also a direct attack on the basic values of a democratic society. The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia guarantees the right to freedom of thought, expression and association. Attempts to stifle those values are not only illegal, but represent a serious blow to foundational human rights and freedoms.

The students in blockades express deep respect toward the courage of Dr Paunić and emphasise that no one may be exposed to pressure for supporting students or for expressing an opinion. This is not only a battle for solidarity, it is a battle for the preservation of basic democratic principles and the rights of every citizen.

We stand by all individuals who have the courage to place dignity and justice before fear and pressure, like Dr Paunić. Only through combined efforts can we build a society in which freedom of speech and solidarity are respected and nurtured, a society in which courage is recognised and justice is not repressed.
