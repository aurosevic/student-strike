Over five months, the students have been trying to achieve the fulfillment of their demands through all legitimate and peaceful means. Despite this, the student demands have not been met, and the authorities have not shown the least initiative to fulfill them in the future.

The student movement initiated protests the numbers of which had not been seen before, showed that the voice of youth was not just noise, but strength which could bring about change, return dignity and awaken hope in justice and freedom, and proved that the sovereignty of our country is in the hands of the people.

With strong conviction that our demands are just, we ascertain that the roots of corruption of authority have breached too deep into national institutions, which are thereby prevented from independently performing their duties.

**We are witnesses to one of the determining moments in the modern history of our country, and as the social group the people have the most confidence in, we make the following decisive move:**

_We demand the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly and calling for snap parliamentary elections in accordance with Article 109 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia._

We believe that democracy is the only correct way to resolve a political crisis of this scale, and so we call for the people to support the electoral list to which the students in blockade of all higher education institutions on the territory of Serbia will entrust their confidence, so that truth may prevail on the scales of justice.
