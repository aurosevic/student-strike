At the request of the group of Radio Television of Serbia workers "Our pRoTeSt", the students in blockade are joining the protest in front of the RTS building in Takovska Street. The protest will be held on March 7th 2025, starting at 6:30 PM.

The workers, dissatisfied with the way of reporting and the editorial policy, and gathered in support of the students' demands, will discuss the problems of the public media service and present their demands at the rally.

The rally will last until 8 PM and will include speeches by students, pupils and workers.

The students in blockade have already gathered in front of RTS several times, pointing out the biased, untrue and unprofessional reporting. At the protest, we will once again point out all the shortcomings of the public media service and call for urgent changes!
