The plenum of students of the Faculty of Media and Communications (FMK) is organizing a protest against the suppression of the blockade, which will take place tomorrow, March 3rd, in front of the faculty building, at the address Karađorđeva 65 in Belgrade. With this protest, the students express their disagreement with the decision of The Teaching and Scholarly Council to continue academic activities, which would end the blockade.

The President of the Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, Ana Brnabić, called the decision of FMK to start classes on March 3rd "D-day" for the exit of state faculties from the blockade. However, the students believe that the faculty gave in under economic and political pressure, and claim that the blockade will last until the demands are met.

In a statement published on February 12th on the Instagram page @studenti.fmk, the plenum of students of the Faculty of Media and Communications clearly emphasized that the decision to continue academic activities was not made in accordance with the will of the plenum. They also appealed to the Faculty to distance itself from Ana Brnabić's statements, which has not happened to date.

Due to the aforementioned reasons, the students decided to enter into a physical blockade of the faculty on February 24th, and this protest represents a continuation of the struggle for the fulfillment of student demands.
