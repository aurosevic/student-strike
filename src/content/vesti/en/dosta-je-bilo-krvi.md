On Monday, June 2, in the morning hours, a professor at the Faculty of Law was attacked by student Mihajlo SekuliÄ‡, a signatory of the so-called Silent Majority.

While the professor was giving signatures to the students, the above-mentioned person jumped the line, for which the professor admonished him for. He pulled the professor by the nose, after which she called the doorman for help. After that, the doorman was also attacked.

We, students in blockade, strongly condemn any form of violence.

At 8 p.m., a protest was held in front of the Faculty of Law. We will not be silent!
