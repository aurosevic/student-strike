For 5 days, students and citizens have been blocking the court and prosecution building in Novi Sad, demanding the release of illegally detained activists, who have been in custody for more than 60 days. Among those detained is professor Marija VasiÄ‡, who has been on a hunger and thirst strike since last Tuesday and after 2 days was transferred to the prison hospital in Belgrade, due to her worsening health condition. Her family still does not have any information about the health status of the professor.

We invite all people who are able to come and help block the court in Sutjeska 3 Street! Until the demands are fulfilled!
