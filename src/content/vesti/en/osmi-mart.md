Students in university blockades in Belgrade invite you to join the all-day-long actions in the streets planned for the 8th of March. 

The first action of the day is "Women at the frontlines". At 1 pm, we will gather at Student Square, from where we will walk to the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office.

The unresponsiveness of institutions and relativisation of violence are part of the female experience even at universities - which is why the female struggle is a vital part of student struggles. 

As part of the protest, 18 minutes of silence will be held - 15 for the victims of the tragedy in Novi Sad and 3 for this year's victims of femicide.  The protest is planned to last until 15:15. 

After that, we invite you to join the traditional March 8th march. The gathering is at 3 pm at Republic Square, where speeches will be held. Then the march will continue to Slavija Square. The gathering is planned to last until 17:30. 

The last in the series of gatherings is the "Shoulder to shoulder" protest, a joint protest of students and workers. Reminiscing on the history of the Eighth of March and the brave textile workers who fought for their labour rights, on the Eighth of March we stand together, fighting for the rights of the workers who have supported us.

We are aware of the selfless support, solidarity and sacrifice that the workers make in support of student demands, and that is why we want to give them our full support.

The gathering will begin with workers and students meeting at the designated meeting places, which you can see on the map.  This is followed by a walk and unification of all workers, students and citizens at Republic Square, honouring the victims and a speech by the workers.
