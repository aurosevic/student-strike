Sretenje (Candlemas) is the day when winter and summer, slavery and freedom, lawlessness and the constitution meet. Sretenje is a day to raise your head and voice, to believe and take action, to talk and gather.

As a sign of seeking justice, a large protest will be held on Lepeniƒçki Bulevar in Kragujevac on February 15.

The prelude to the protest on Saturday will be the welcoming of students who have been walking towards Kragujevac for several days. The welcome is planned for Friday, February 14, at 7:30 p.m.

A fifteen-hour blockade will be held on Saturday, which will begin at 9:00 a.m. and last until 00:07 a.m., and an extension could be voted on at the civic plenum if it happens. The whole day will be filled with different activities.

We invite you to stand up together and once again hold our heads high and demand truth, accountability and justice. This Sretenje will be one of the most significant in history. Join us in writing it!

Let's meet at Sretenje
