An edict is a decision which brings about new rules. Now the students of Serbia are adopting their own - the Student Edict, a message that we will now longer accept injustice, corruption and an inefficient system which limits us.

Some traces fade, while some become a part of history. We invite you to write the pages of the future together and leave an irremovable sign of our battle.
 
We are gathering in the centre of Niš on 1 March because we know that we deserve better, not only in education, but in society. We want institutions which work for the benefit of all of us, not to our detriment. We want a system which values knowledge and work, not obedience and silence.
 
The welcome of the students who are coming to Niš by walking, running or bicycle will serve as a prelude to the protest. On Friday, 28 February, the cyclists and runners will arrive first, and their welcome will be organised before the technical faculties at 17:30, from where we will head to the National Theatre, where we will welcome the walking students at 20:00.
 
The protest on Saturday will last a symbolic 18 hours - from 9:00 in the morning until 3:00 after midnight. These 18 hours are not incidental. It is the calling code for Niš, but also a call for necessary change, a shift from apathy to action, from silence to a loud battle for a  better future. A daylong programme is planned for the protest.

Every second of this protest, we are writing new pages of history. We are gathering because we will not watch as our future slips away from us in front of our very eyes.
 
Every word, every voice, every step - they are a part of the change we are building. This is not an ordinary protest. This is our edict, our decision to fight for a system which values knowledge, justice and freedom.
 
On 1 March, Niš will be the epicentre of student resistance. It is time for everyone to hear. It is time for everyone to see.
