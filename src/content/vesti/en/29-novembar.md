Our colleague, a student at the Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering, was unexpectedly detained by the police around 8 pm this evening as he was returning from a German language class.

By 10 pm, his lawyer was not given information on the place of his detainment, which is a serious breach of fundamental rights and legal norms of the Republic of Serbia.

We ask all students, professors, citizens and media to instantly assemble before the Police Department building on the 29th November Street, in order to demand urgentrelease of our colleague and accountabilityof those responsible for this unlawful detainment. Your presence is crucial in the combat against injustice andprotection of rights of every individual.

We will not stopuntil our colleague is released!
