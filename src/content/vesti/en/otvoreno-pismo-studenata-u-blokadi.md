We, the students, initiated the blockades of faculties in response to the silence of the institutions and injustice. Our struggle is not only a student struggle - it is a symbol of wider social resistance. Our rebellion became a spark that encouraged other social groups to raise their voices and not agree to injustice.

Today, Serbia is not silent. Today, workers, educators, lawyers, farmers and many others stand side by side with students.

- Educators in dozens of schools suspended classes, demanding better working conditions and the dignity of the profession.
- The Bar Association of Serbia announced a suspension of work for 30 days due to the collapse of the judiciary and legal uncertainty.
- The farmers, who have been with us since day one, continue their struggle for survival and the right to a dignified life.
- Cultural workers and artists publicly supported student blockades, clearly saying that the fight is also for freedom of expression.
- Workers of the City Transport Company (GSP) joined the protests, pointing to poor working conditions and the need for change.
- Employees of the Electric Power Company of Serbia (EPS) expressed dissatisfaction with the dismissal of union leaders and the state of affairs in the company.
- The employees of Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) pointed to pressures and censorship, demanding media freedom and objective information.

Workers from different sectors are protesting, while unions are announcing new strikes.

It is important that we all understand: this is not just a series of separate battles. This is a fight - a fight against the injustice that suffocates us, disenfranchises us and forces us into silence.

Today, no one who struggles is alone. We are the wind at each others' backs. 

That's why we want to say to everyone who had the courage to stand up against injustice: Thank you!

We are stronger together. Let's hold on!
