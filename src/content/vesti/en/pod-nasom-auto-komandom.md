We invite you to join us in a 24-hour blockade of the Auto-komanda interchange, which will begin on Monday the 27th at 10:00 a.m. The blockade will span from part of Bulevar oslobođenja up to the junction of Ustanička, Južni bulevar and Nebojšina Street. The exact boundaries of the blockade may be seen on the picture below.

## Activity timetable

- 13:00 Start of “Cooking with students”
- 16:00 Blockade half-court basketball
- 18:00 Arrival of workers and their speech
- 20:00 Turning on flashlights on phones and reading of demands

## Precautions at the blockade

We implore you not to go out onto the highway during the blockade at Auto-komanda, as such actions could jeopardise your safety and the safety of other traffic participants. Additionally, we implore you not to go out onto the tram tracks to enable undisrupted passage of ambulance vehicles, and not to come to the location before 10 a.m.

The organisation of the blockade was conceived as a peaceful protest which clearly sends a message, but it must not bring about accidents or unnecessary risks. However, if you decide upon such an action, we warn that you do so exclusively at your own responsibility. We ask that everyone stick to the agreed-upon blockade rules and movement plan to keep everyone present safe.

We especially ask that all instructions from monitors be strictly followed so that everything may pass in good order and so that we ensure the successful realisation of the protest together. Thank you for your understanding and for contributing to the success of our shared fight with your good behaviour.

We repeat that we distance ourselves from any connections with political parties, politicians or non-governmental organisations. Our fight pertains exclusively to citizens and students, but as always, everyone is welcome to support us as a citizen – without any party, political or organisational symbols.

Thank you for standing by us and for supporting our fight for justice and accountability.

Respectfully, 
Students in blockades
