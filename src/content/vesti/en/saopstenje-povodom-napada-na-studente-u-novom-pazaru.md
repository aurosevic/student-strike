We are horrified by yet another attack on students, this time on colleagues from Novi Pazar, who were hit by a car during today's blockade of the main road. One colleague sustained minor injuries to his hand.

The attack on our colleagues occurred just a few days after high-ranking officials and institutions with mostly ceremonial powers declared that they would destroy us, while also calling for a peaceful dialogue.

An attack on one of us is not only an attack on an individual, but also on an entire community that fights for justice, freedom and a healthy society. We stand resolutely and in solidarity with all our colleagues throughout Serbia and call on all citizens to unite and to even stronger continue our fight for justice !

Together with all our colleagues and until our demands are met,  
Students in Blockade
