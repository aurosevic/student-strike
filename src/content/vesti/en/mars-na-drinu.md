To mark the Victory Day over Fascism, as well as on the occasion of entering the sixth month of the blockade of most higher education institutions, the student initiative from Loznica is calling for a protest to be held on **May 9**.

In addition to the fact that the institutions have been ignoring our requests for five months, additional concern is caused by the government’s attempt to push through the implementation of the “Jadar” project in the current “chaotic” state of the country.

For this reason, students from Loznica want to clearly point out the importance of preserving the environment of our city, and therefore of the whole of Serbia.

> We, the students whose demands are still not met, want to make it clear that we carefully monitor and recognize any (mis)deed directed against the interests of citizens. These acts are not only an attack on the present, but also an obstacle for the future – for a society that respects nature, preserves cultural heritage and cherishes the basic values ​​of equality and freedom.

We don’t want to be passive observers. We are active participants in building a state that must belong to everyone – not just the privileged and powerful. That is why we believe that this protest is necessary, so that the general public becomes aware of the seriousness of the problem, which, although it may seem distant at first glance, affects all of us – as well as the generations to come.
