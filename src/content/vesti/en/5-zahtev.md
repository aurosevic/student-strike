We demand a thorough investigation by the competent authorities to determine all circumstances and liabilities regarding the phenomenon that caused fear and panic on March 15, 2025 at 7:11 PM along Kralja Milana Street, during a peaceful protest and 15 minutes of silence in memory of the tragic victims in Novi Sad.

## **Specification:** 

On Saturday, March 15, 2025, during a peaceful protest and tribute to the victims in Novi Sad, a phenomenon of unknown origin occurred, which caused fear and panic among citizens. Given the seriousness of this event and its potential safety implications, and in accordance with the legal obligations of the competent authorities in the field of maintaining public order, peace and safety of citizens, we demand the conduct of a thorough investigation, as well as determining all relevant circumstances, including:

1. Identification of the technology used and the location from which the unidentified phenomenon was caused;
2. Determination of the legal basis and purpose of the application of the unidentified technology, as well as the determination of the grounds and justification of its application on March 15, 2025;
3. Identification of the person who ordered and executed the action that led to the unidentified phenomenon, and the initiation of appropriate proceedings in accordance with the law, without delay;
4. The manner in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other competent authorities will prevent the unfounded and unjustified application of unidentified technology as a means of coercion during peaceful gatherings of citizens in the future.

This request arises from the need to protect the right of citizens to a peaceful assembly, which is clearly defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and the Law on the National Assembly. The rights to freedom of assembly and expression of opinion are one of the fundamental pillars of a democratic society. It is evident that this is an act of intimidation of citizens and a violation of fundamental human rights.

According to the Law on Public Prosecutor's Office, holders of the Public Prosecutor's Office are expected to perform their duties professionally, conscientiously, impartially, fairly and without unnecessary delay, and to respect the independence of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

According to the Law on Police, members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to behave professionally, to act impartially and depoliticized, and to respect legal regulations.

Establishing the facts and specific responsibility for the use of unidentified technology as a means of coercion during a peaceful tribute to the victims in Novi Sad is a key step towards ensuring the protection of human rights and preventing similar incidents in the future.
