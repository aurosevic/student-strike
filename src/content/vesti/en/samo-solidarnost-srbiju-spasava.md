In accordance with decentralization and drawing attention to problems in smaller towns, high school graduates and students from Aranđelovac are organizing a protest on May 12.

Since the beginning of the blockade, several groups of citizens have supported students and high school graduates, for which they suffered great pressure. The problem of every small place is that everyone knows each other, which leads to respect for advocacy, but often to more direct repression and pressure.

> In our city, educators were the first to stand up to student demands, followed immediately by teachers. Due to enormous pressures, most of them had to leave the blockade, and a disciplinary procedure was initiated against one of our teachers, who is still suspended, because he supports our struggle. One of our fellow citizens was detained for seeking information of public importance, and another of our fellow citizens, who provided transportation for several public gatherings in different cities, was sent to an inspection before March 15 and was threatened that Molotov cocktails would be thrown at him on the bus. Also, one of our priests was dismissed by the Metropolitan of Šumadija for his support of the student protests, and together with his wife, he was taken to the premises of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and prevented from attending the service.

This public action aims to show the support and solidarity of the citizens of Aranđelovac who suffer pressures, as well as to show that their students and graduates are persistent in our fight to fulfill the demands despite the various types of pressures they suffer together with their fellow citizens. The goal of the public action is to show that the student’s will has not been suppressed despite all the pressures.
