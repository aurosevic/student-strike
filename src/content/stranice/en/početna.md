The collapse of the canopy at the Railway Station in Novi Sad on Friday, November 1, 2024, at 11:52, killed 15 people. The death of innocent victims caused collective sorrow. Citizens paused in the streets at 11:52AM to honor the victims with a 15-minute silence. People in Serbia continue to gather regularly in various locations across the country, always at the same time â€“ 11:52.

Over 60 faculties and higher education schools across Serbia are currently in blockade.

We have no individuals who stand above the community. We reject a personality cult. Our efforts are collective, deliberate and responsible. We protest in the streets not for personal gain, but for an idea. This is not the time nor place for self-promotion, but for solidarity and camaraderie.
