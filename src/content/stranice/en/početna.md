mreza_solidarnosti: The Solidarity Network
mreza_solidarnosti_tekst: |-
  The Solidarity Network came from the IT sector as a temporary system of direct financial support which connects:
  - **donors** - people who want to help financially;
  - **affected teachers and non-teaching staff** - those who are on strike and whose salaries have been cut.

  The aim is to provide fast, secure and transparent assistance without a centralized fund and intermediary - money goes directly from donor to teacher per the peer-to-peer direct donation model, without intermediaries, with mutual trust.

  Recently, university teachers have been included in the support system. So far, more than 3,500 educators have connected through the Solidarity Network who have been compensated for their lost salaries, with donations exceeding 120 million dinars, but *a lot more funding* is still needed.

  **Let's show that solidarity is not just a word - no teacher will be left to face injustice alone.**

The collapse of the canopy at the Railway Station in Novi Sad on Friday, November 1, 2024, at 11:52, killed 15 people. The death of innocent victims caused collective sorrow. Citizens paused in the streets at 11:52AM to honor the victims with a 15-minute silence. People in Serbia continue to gather regularly in various locations across the country, always at the same time – 11:52.
