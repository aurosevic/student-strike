# About the Blockades

The collapse of the canopy at the Railway Station in Novi Sad on Friday, November 1, 2024, at 11:52, killed 15 people. The death of innocent victims caused collective sorrow. Citizens paused in the streets at 11:52AM to honor the victims with a 15-minute silence. People in Serbia continue to gather regularly in various locations across the country, always at the same time â€“ 11:52.

On November 22, 2024, students and professors of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade gathered near the faculty to pay tribute to the victims. During the gathering, which had been announced in advance, students and professors of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts were physically attacked by an organized group of people. Two students suffered minor injuries.

Four days after the incident, students from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts initiated a blockade of the faculty in response to the lack of action from the police and the prosecutor's office. After the Faculty of Dramatic Arts began its blockade, the building of the Rectorate of the University of Belgrade was also blocked on Monday, December 2, 2024. Following the Faculty of Dramatic Arts, the Faculty of Philosophy, Faculty of Philology, Faculty of Chemistry, and Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade also initiated blockades.

In the days that followed, one faculty after another voted to start a blockade at plenums, which are direct-democratic assemblies where all students can participate with equal voting rights.

Over 60 faculties and higher education schools across Serbia are currently in blockade.
