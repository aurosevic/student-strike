      Official statements, decisions, actions, support announcements, etc., that have been voted on by all students of the higher education institutions involved in the blockade in Belgrade are exclusively published on our [Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/studenti_u_blokadi), [X account](https://x.com/studentblokade), [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/people/Studenti-u-blokadi-UB/61571631694236/), and this website.
